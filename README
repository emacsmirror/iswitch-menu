iswitch-menu is an Emacs extension that aims to make the console menu
interface for emacs much efficient and easy to use, based on the
iswitchb mode for switching buffers by substring/regexp matching

currently this is far from finished, but it works reasonably well with
the emacs-rails package, if you switch rails-always-use-text-menus on.

notable bugs: 
 
 disabled menu items aren't.
 submenus passed as symbols (variables) are not recognized.
